# Fake_News_Classification
This repository contains files for creating fake news classifiers. The first uses Scikit-Learn to create Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SGD Classifiers on both count and tf-idf vectorized text. The second uses TensorFlow to create a Dense Sequential Network, a CNN network, a hybrid CNN-RNN, and a Bidirectional LSTM network
